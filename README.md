This study addresses the challenge of generating biomedical data when available samples are insufficient for multivariate modeling in machine learning and deep learning. Using microscopic images of eight peripheral blood cell classes from the BloodMNIST database, the research highlights the importance of both cell morphology and RGB color distribution in classification.  

Color differentiation was initially assessed through histograms and the k-means algorithm, identifying six dominant colors. Further analysis using UMAP and distance matrices revealed that the blue component had minimal impact and could be excluded from the loss function.  

For data generation, various conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN) architectures were tested. The Mixture-of-Experts cGAN, incorporating residual blocks and LeakyReLU activation, yielded the best results, achieving a classification accuracy of 0.97 for newly generated data. However, high class similarity, as shown by statistical and unsupervised analyses, led to some classification errors in synthetic images.
